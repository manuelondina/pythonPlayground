If you get [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] you need to download CERT file from amazon.es website and add the local path of the file in line 10.
Also comment line 8 since now it will be using line 10 instead

Certificate file might be: wwww.amazon.es.cert (When downloading certificate > pick Base 64 certificate chain)
